# 👋 Hey, I'm Krishnanand Anil  

🏗️ **Data Engineer | Warehouse Whisperer | Pipeline Therapist**

I build data warehouses that *don’t* collapse under their own joins, pipelines that *actually* run on schedule, and platforms that make analysts smile (yes, it’s possible).  

My specialty? Turning chaos into clean, queryable gold — and making sure your data warehouse is the one place everyone actually trusts.

---

### 🧠 What I Actually Do
- 🏗️ Design **data warehouses** that scale (and don’t need a “fix_v2_final_final” table)  
- ⚙️ Build **ETL/ELT pipelines** using DBT, PySpark, and AWS Glue  
- 🧩 Create **dimensional models** that make dashboards fly  
- ☁️ Tame **AWS monsters** like Redshift, Lambda, and Kinesis  
- 📘 Automate **lineage, docs, and data quality** because nobody should write that manually

---

### 💡 My Stack of Choice
| Area | Tools & Tech |
|------|---------------|
| **Data Warehouse** | Redshift, Snowflake, Postgres |
| **Transformations** | DBT, PySpark, Glue |
| **Modeling** | Kimball, Data Vault, Star Schema |
| **Metadata & Lineage** | OpenMetadata, Amundsen |
| **Infra** | AWS, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes |
| **Languages** | Python, SQL (my first language), JavaScript (for front-end fun) |

---

### 🚀 Recent Shenanigans
- 🧮 Built a **central data warehouse** combining Finance, Ops, and Product data → Cut reporting time by **80%**  
- ⚡ Architected a **real-time event pipeline** (50M+ events/day) → Redshift didn’t cry once  
- 🧠 Automated **DBT docs + OpenMetadata** → So the team finally stopped asking “where does this column come from?”

---

### 🧰 Currently Experimenting With
- **Metadata-driven data warehouse automation** (yes, it’s as nerdy as it sounds)  
- **LLMs for data documentation** (because ChatGPT explains columns better than humans sometimes)  
- **Svelte + FastAPI dashboards** (because pretty > plain text outputs)

---

### 🌱 Things I’m Trying to Master
- Making Redshift go *brrr* without cluster meltdowns  
- Saying “data mesh” without starting a debate  
- Actually finishing my side projects before starting new ones 😅

### 💬 Let’s Talk About
Data architecture, analytics platforms, or why *SELECT \** is a life choice, not a query.

⭐️ Poke around my repos — you’ll find a mix of **data platform blueprints**, **SEO toys**, and **scripts that made my life easier (and maybe yours too)**.  
If something makes you chuckle *and* runs without errors, that’s a win in my book ☕
